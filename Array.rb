# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts
(0..5).each do |i|
  puts "adding #{i} to the list."
  # pushes the i variable on the *end* of the list
  elements.push(i)
end

# now we can print them out too
elements.each {|i| puts "Element was: #{i}" }
